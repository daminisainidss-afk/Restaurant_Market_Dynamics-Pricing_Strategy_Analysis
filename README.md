# Restaurant_Market_Dynamics-Pricing_Strategy_Analysis.

This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of the restaurant landscape across major metropolitan hubs in India. By leveraging data-driven metrics, the analysis identifies the correlation between investment (average cost) and market penetration (customer engagement). The objective is to provide stakeholders with actionable insights into pricing strategies and popularity drivers within the F&B industry.

Business Intelligence Framework

To move beyond basic data points, I engineered custom Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to evaluate market standing:

Popularity Index (PI): A proprietary metric calculated by weighting Aggregate Ratings against Total Customer Engagement (Votes). This offers a more accurate representation of brand equity than rating alone.

Price Segmentation: A tiered classification (Budget, Mid-Range, Premium) designed to benchmark establishments against their direct competitors.

Visual Analytics & Strategic Insights
The project utilizes advanced data visualization to uncover market trends:

Segment Distribution: A statistical breakdown of the market to identify oversaturated vs. underserved price brackets.

Investment vs. Reach Analysis: A multi-dimensional scatter plot (Bubble Chart) evaluating the ROI of pricing strategies. This visualizes whether higher-priced establishments are successfully converting their premium positioning into customer loyalty.

Technical Implementation

Core Engine: Python 3.x

Data Wrangling: Pandas & NumPy

Advanced Visualization: Seaborn (with customized professional aesthetics) and Matplotlib.

Professional Engagement
